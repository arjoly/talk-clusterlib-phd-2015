The genesis of clusterlib
=========================

An open source library to tame your favourite supercomputer

The presentations tells the story of clusterlib an open source package
from the problem statement to a first grade an open source library.
Awesome tools are also presented for software projects.

The goal of the clusterlib is to ease the creation,
launch and management of embarrassingly parallel jobs
on supercomputers with schedulers such as SLURM and SGE.
